I am a PhD student in Data Science and Engineering in the
[Bredesen Center for Interdisciplinary Studies and Graduate Education](https://bredesencenter.utk.edu) at
[the University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://www.utk.edu). For the past two years I have been researching how data
science principles may be leveraged for metal additive manufacturing throughout the entire toolchain - modeling and
simulations, process optimization, data management, in-situ monitoring, defect detection, and post-build analysis.

Additionally, I am interested in studying and developing policies for data collection, data management and algorithms
as these tools become more pervasive and consequential in our society.
