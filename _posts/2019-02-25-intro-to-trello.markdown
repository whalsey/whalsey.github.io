# INTRODUCTION
Time management has not been one of my fortes historically. I procrastinate. I forget or fail to plan for important
events. I feel that I am not reaching my potential. However, I have made great strides towards reversing these trends
over the past few years, and [Trello](https://trello.com) has been the primary tool that I have used to organize my
life, mange my time, and prioritize my tasks. This and several subsequent posts will serve to introduce you to Trello
and show you how I employ it in my day-to-day life.

Trello is a simple tool, and it is that simplicity is what makes it so powerful and adaptable. At its most basic Trello
allows users to create various boards; these boards are made up of lists; the lists made up of cards.
